# RiseVirus
About the game

RiseVirus was supposed to be my entry for Mini Jame Gam (46).
I ran into a ton of bugs, errors, and headaches, so in the end, I just submitted a very simplified version.

What the game actually has:

A main menu (with music 🎶).

Playable room where viruses fall randomly.

A balloon that follows your mouse and tries to survive.

Game Over screen (just a background, super basic).

That’s it. It’s extremely simple, but hey — it works!

# Controls

Move the balloon with your mouse.

Press Enter to restart after dying.

Press ESC to go back to the menu.

# Important note

This is literally the first playable project I’ve ever made in my life.
I was learning the basics of GameMaker while constantly “tweaking things my way” (which probably broke more stuff than it fixed 😅).

So yeah — expect chaos inside these files.

# Assets

The cool part of this project is definitely the assets: images, gifs, and music. They’re included here if you want to take a look or reuse them.

The only problem? The actual game itself. (😭)

Thanks
